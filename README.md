## Disclaimer
Better deepfake software than this already exist, this is just a hobby project I created to learn about AI. Users are expected to use this program for learning programming and using the software in good faith. Users must get consent from the concerned people before using their face and must not hide the fact that it is a deepfake when posting content online. I am not responsible for malicious behaviour of end-users.
